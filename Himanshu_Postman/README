API Assignment

Description- Create a Postman collection Framework of using GET, POST,PUT and DELETE rest call and i integrate with CI/CD tool. -http://dummy.restapiexample.com/

Guidelines-
1. Newman should be used to run the collections.
2. Test cases should be there.
3. Prerequisites test scripts should be used for creating dynamic data.
4. Valid assertions should be used.
5. Headers should be used 
6. Query string parameter should be used.
7. Test script should be used in javascript.
8. No hardcoded values should be used.
9. Proper Test reports should be created.
10. Environment variable should be used.

Solution-

In my Postman Assignment, I have used a dummy API: https://gorest.co.in which is further used to perform GET, POST, PUT and DELETE rest call.

1. We can run POST, GET, PUT and DELETE method by simply click on Send Request.
2. We can run a collection by clicking on three dot and there we will see Run collection. Click on Run collection and run your collection. Here we can also run our collection by adding a csv file.

3. To run collection in Newman:
a. First export your collection from postman and also export your environment from environment.
b. Open your terminal in the following folder, run the command:
	newman run myCollectionname.json -e myenvironmentname.json
	
By running this command, your collection will run and we will get passed/failed cases.

c. To generate report, run this command on the terminal:
		newman run myCollectionname.json -e myenvironmentname.json --reporters=cli,htmlextra 
		
By running this command, a report is generated that we can use for our reference.
